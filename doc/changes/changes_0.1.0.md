# CloudWatch-adapter 0.1.0, released 2021-03-03

Code name: Initial release

## Summary

This is the very first release of the Exasol â€“ CloudWatch adapter.

Known issue:

* In case your Exasol database uses a timezone with time-shift as `DBTIMEZONE`, this adapter will **not report** the hour when the time is shifted back, since Exasol stores the statistics entries in the `DBTIMEZONE` and by that, the log entries are ambiguous in that hour (see [#2](https://github.com/exasol/cloudwatch-adapter/issues/2)).
* Due to a bug in SAM we can not publish the app with a retry count set to 0. This can lead to duplicate reported data if the Lambda fails after reporting some points and EventBridge triggers it again (see [#21](https://github.com/exasol/cloudwatch-adapter/issues/21)).

## Features / Enhancements

* #7: Added additional metrics: `NET`, `SWAP`, `DB_RAM_SIZE`, `NODES`
* #30: Added configuration for VPC

* #31: Added wrapper for AWS SDK exceptions

## Documentation

* #28: Added documentation on VPC
* #22: Added a guide for manual deployment
